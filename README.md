This is was a project complete during the Computer Programming course at Alogonquin College Ottawa.

This project was made in the Program Language Research class.
This project revolves around data manipulation.
The Language I chose to learn was python.
The project gave different implementation tasks depending on the language.
There are 4 parts to this project, each with more implemetations. This is the fourth and last implementation.
At the end of each section of the project I was tasked with creating Documentation for new implmentations.
